# Python-NYC-taxis-trips-analysis
Final project for BUDT758X @ University of Maryland

Four datasets:

1st: 2016 NYC central park average temperature (file uploaded)

2nd: 2016 Jan-June NYC taxi trips (file too big to upload)

3rd: NYC Restaurant Inspection Record (file too big to upload)

4th: Zipcode - lats & longs conversion (url)

Two mapbox plots cannot be shown in the code file, but they are included in the repository as png format.


Project Overview:


Transportation spending is an important part of everyone's daily expenses, although trip modes and purposes differ among people. Whether you drive your own car, or take the metro/shuttle to school or workplace, there are always some special circumstances, such as no parking lots around the destination, long walking distance on rainy days and metro/shuttleâ€™s unsuitable schedule. At those moments, people in NYC(most of them use public transportation, plus so few residents own or need to own a car.) will use taxi service so that they can arrive at the destination on time. Compared with private cars and public transportation, the biggest advantage of this type of service is a combination of high degree of mobility and flexibility. For this project, we will use the dataset of 2016 NYC taxi trips to conduct the research. We are going to figure out the answers of the following questions. NYC has 5 areas,the Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island.

Questions:


1.How do different factors affect the trip duration (weather, distance, and weekend or not)?

2.Do the peak hours for the weekday and the weekend distribute differently?

3.What areas have more dense pick-up spots for taxi drivers? Why?
